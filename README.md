## 🛠 **Project Overview**  
This project involves setting up a **comprehensive Active Directory (AD) security lab** that integrates **Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team** to:  
✅ **Simulate real-world cyber threats**  
✅ **Ingest security events into a SIEM**  
✅ **Generate attack-related telemetry**  
✅ **Enhance log analysis and threat detection skills**  

## 🎯 **Key Objectives**  
✔️ **Deploy and configure** an Active Directory lab with multiple security tools  
✔️ **Simulate adversary behavior** using **Atomic Red Team** to create real-world attack scenarios  
✔️ **Monitor and analyze security logs** in **Splunk** for **incident detection**  
✔️ **Investigate network attacks** using **Wireshark** and log data  
✔️ **Enhance cybersecurity expertise** through hands-on learning  

## 🧠 **Skills Developed**  
💡 **SIEM Implementation & Log Analysis** – Mastering log ingestion, correlation, and alerting in Splunk  
💡 **Threat Hunting & Detection** – Identifying attack signatures and suspicious activities  
💡 **Network Security & Traffic Analysis** – Using Wireshark to inspect network packets  
💡 **Active Directory Security** – Understanding domain attacks and mitigation techniques  
💡 **Incident Response & Forensics** – Investigating security incidents and applying mitigation strategies  

## 🛠 **Tech Stack & Tools Used**  
🔹 **Splunk** – SIEM for security event collection and analysis  
🔹 **Kali Linux** – Ethical hacking & penetration testing  
🔹 **Atomic Red Team** – Open-source framework for adversary simulation  
🔹 **Wireshark** – Packet capture and network traffic inspection  
🔹 **Windows Server & Active Directory** – Configured with security auditing & logging  

## 🚀 **Project Highlights**  
📌 **Configured a full-fledged Active Directory environment with multiple security layers**  
📌 **Simulated real-world attack techniques (MITRE ATT&CK framework)**  
📌 **Implemented custom SIEM alerts** to detect malicious activities  
📌 **Performed forensic analysis on security logs** to improve detection capabilities
